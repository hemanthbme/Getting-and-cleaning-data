Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Variables:

traindata - all the numerical values of the research in the training set
testdata - all the numerical values of the rewsearch in the test data
X - merged numerical values of test and train data

act_train_num - number assigned to a particluar activity in training set (eg: 1 was assigned for walking)
act_test_num - number assigned to a particular activity in test set
Y - merged data of act_train_num and act_test_num

sub_train - number assigned to subject in the training set
sub_test - number assigned for the subject in test set
subject - merged data of sub_train and sub_test (combined the training and test subjects)

f- all the features or labels for the data set 'X'
features - converted f to character with the number of labels length

mean_std - extracted the labels with mean and standard divation measurements
act_lab - charcater lables of activity to be assigned to Y

merged_data - merging the data X,Y, subjects to get one clean and tidy dataset
avg_data - an independent tidy dataset created as per requirement which shows the average value of the each activity ion each subject.


run_analysis.R:
1. the data is downloaded into the system and the files are unzipped.
2. the test and training data sets are called in R and merged with rbind. the so formed three datasets are: X,Y, and subjects
3. features test file is loaded inot R and mean and standard deviation of the required labels were extracted and the respective 
values from the numerical dataset 'X' was extracted (numericals associated with mean and standard deviation of required variables.
4. activities_label dataset was loaded and was merged with Y to have charcater assigned instead of numerical values in Y.
5. the data in X, Y and subject was merged to have one tidy dataset.
6. As per requirement, another dataset was created which is independent of the merged data, and which shows the average values of each
variable for each subject.
